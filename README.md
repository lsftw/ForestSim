# ForestSim
2D sidescrolling forest simulation.

# Roadmap
## Basic Plants
* Support composite entities, such as grass patches and trees
* Add wind and swaying mechanics to plants
## Multiple Layers - Pseudo-3D
* Support multiple scenes, showing background and foreground scenes as 2d layer slices

First progress screenshot. Rectangle grass with random size, count, and color. Camera movement support.

Second progress screenshot. Added composite entity support, which grass patches use. Grass patches subtly sway with the wind left and right.
