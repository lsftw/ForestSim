# ForestSim
2D sidescrolling forest simulation.

# Roadmap
## Basic Plants
* Add wind and swaying mechanics to plants
## Graphical Layering
* Allow some entities to be in the foreground or background
* Add parallax effect
## Multiple Logical Layers - Pseudo-3D
* Support multiple scenes, showing background and foreground scenes as 2d layer slices

First progress screenshot. Rectangle grass with random size, count, and color. Camera movement support.

Second progress screenshot. Added composite entity support, which grass patches use. Grass patches subtly sway with the wind left and right.

Third progress screenshot. Added very simple shrubs.

Fourth progress screenshot. Added very simple tree trunks.

Fifth progress screenshot. Added evergreen trees.
